NOTE
1. In the first commit, the entire code is generated using jhipster's scaffolding which is extremely detailed compared to Ruby - it adds a lot of boilerplate Java and React code, along with sample data to begin with for every entity.
2. Pagination is enabled for every entity which will have large amount of data.
3. docker compose is disabled to use the local instances of mysql and redis.
